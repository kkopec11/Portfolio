        As an experienced front-end developer and a computer science graduate
        with a specialization in databases, I aspire to become a full-stack web
        developer in the future. <br />I am enthusiastic about all areas of
        programming, with a fascination for the front-end, especially React.
        <br />
        This is complemented by an analytical approach, as evidenced by my
        success as a data analyst and SAS programmer. <br />I also have
        experience participating in international projects using Scrum and Agile
        methodologies.
