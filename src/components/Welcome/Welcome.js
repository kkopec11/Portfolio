                As a graduating IT enginer with data-base specialization I am aiming to become a full-stack web developer in the future. <br />
                I am enthusiastic about all fields of programming, with a fascination for front-end and especially React.<br />
                This is complimented by an analytical approach as evidenced by my success as a Data Science Analyst and SAS Developer.
